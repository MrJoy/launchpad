# Changes

## v0.2.1

* Missed a file rename.
* Remove some broken/not-quite-supported, and no longer particurly useful features from Novation Launchpad support.  (Specifically, column-wise/row-wise/board-wise changing of lights in paletted mode.)
* Fix test suite.
* Break apart a lot of complexity.


## v0.2.0

* Initial release, based on [launchpad](https://github.com/thomasjachmann/launchpad) gem.
* Almost full support for Novation Launchpad Mark 2 (the one with RGB LEDs), missing flashing/pulsing of lights, etc.
* Partial support for Numark Orbit.
